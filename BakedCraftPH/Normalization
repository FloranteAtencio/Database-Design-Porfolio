BakedCraftPH Database
1st Normal Form:
•	Each attribute should contain atomic value.
•	A column should contain value from the same domain.
•	Each column should have a unique name. 
•	No ordering to rows and columns.
•	No duplicate rows.
2ND Normal Form
•	It must be 1st Normal Form.
•	No Patial dependency in the relation (Partial dependency occurs when the left-hand side of a candidate key points non-prime attributes).
3rd Normal Form
•	It must be 2nd Normal Form.																         
•	No transitive dependency for non-prime attributes (To be non-transitive and 3NF at least one of these must be true: Either the left-hand side of functional dependency is super key or the right-hand side points to a prime attribute).
BCNF
•	if it is 3NF. 
•	For each functional dependency there must be a super key.
Preserving Dependency Decomposition
•	is another property of decomposed relational database schema D in which each functional dependency X -> Y specified in F either appeared directly in one of the relation schemas Ri in the decomposed D or could be inferred from the dependencies that appear in some Ri.

Lossless Join Decomposition
•	Lossless join decomposition is a decomposition of a relation R into relations R1, R2 such that if we perform a natural join of relation R1 and R2, it will return the original relation R. This is effective in removing redundancies from databases while preserving the original data.
